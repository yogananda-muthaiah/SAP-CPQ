Approval from Customer to be provided in the ticket
Before the process is initiated, the backup of destination data is taken, in case emergency arises. 
Clients can expect to have an exact copy of source domain on destination domain in every aspect. This means destination domain will have same data for products, attributes, users, quotes, images, document generation templates, application parameters, integration settings, report module settings, customers etc. Once the domain refresh/transfer is completed, it is up to CLIENT to perform necessary adjustments.
When it comes to Integration feature activation requests, procedure is to match previous availability state of the integration features; whatever integration the client had prior to tenant transfer, they will have it after tenant transfer.
